Prerequisites

  Python

    Any relatively modern version of python will work.  It was developed on 2.7, but little should
    prevent it from running on later versions.

  Chrome or Chromium Web Browser

    Chromed was written to drive the Chrom* browsers, but parts of it could easily be adapted to
    any browser that supports websockets.

  Pywebsocket

    Pywebsocket is an experimental Apache module that implements a websocket server.  To install
    pywebsocket, follow the directions at http://code.google.com/p/pywebsocket/


Installation

  In the web browser, view the page chrome://extensions.  Near the top of the page on the right
  hand side is an expansion toggle, 'Developer mode'.  Make sure that it is expanded.  Look to the
  left of it for a longish button titled 'Load unpacked extension'.  Click it.  Navigate to the
  extension folder in the chromed source tree.  Click open.  The Chromed extension should now
  appear in your list of apps and extensions.
